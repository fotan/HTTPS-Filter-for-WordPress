HTTPS-Filter-for-WordPress
==========================

Plugin that filters HTTP embeds (like YouTube) and forces them to pull from HTTPS


WordPress 3.6+ includes an oembed filter that, in theory, should take care of it, but all it really does is takes the https:// input and pulls the video from YouTube's http:// server.  Stupid.


To Use:
Upload to wp-content/plugins and enable just like any plugin.

There are no settings or menus added to Dashboard.  It just works.
